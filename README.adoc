--->== ConTeXt source code

This repository hosts ConTeXt, a TeX macro package. There are three versions:

MkII:: the frozen version meant for pdfTeX
MkIV:: the mostly frozen version meant for LuaTeX
MkXL:: the latest version running on LuaMetaTeX

Here we collect all the file needed to run ConTeXt, including the sources of
LuaMetaTeX. More information can be found on the wiki:

For support there is a mailing list available ntg-context@ntg.nl
